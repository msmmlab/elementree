## TASK:

Using node.js with an Express NPM component as the backend API framework, create a single API endpoint which will generate a number of randomly located geometry coordinates within a given boundary box and return coordinates as an array of lat/long dictionaries or named arrays.

Create a simple React.js based front end using the above API endpoint and plot the coordinates on a map. We use Mapbox as our mapping component, but you can use any of your preferred tools.
